# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists, including path-scoped framework guidelines under `.ai/rules/boost`. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== laravel-octane/core rules ===

# Laravel Octane

This application uses Laravel Octane, a long-running PHP server. The application bootstraps once and handles many requests within the same process.

- Never store request-specific state in singletons or static properties, because it can leak across requests.
- Use `config('octane.server')` to detect the active driver (`swoole`, `roadrunner`, or `frankenphp`).
- Prefer scoped bindings (`$this->app->scoped()`) over singletons for per-request services.

When working on Octane-specific features (concurrency, shared tables, memory, driver configuration, testing), invoke `octane-development` for detailed rules.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This project uses PHPUnit. Create tests with `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `php artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.

=== spatie/laravel-medialibrary/core rules ===

## Media Library

- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` associates files with Eloquent models, with support for collections, conversions, and responsive images.
- Always activate the `medialibrary-development` skill when working with media uploads, conversions, collections, responsive images, or any code that uses the `HasMedia` interface or `InteractsWithMedia` trait.

</laravel-boost-guidelines>

## General code instructions
 
- Don't generate code comments above the methods or code blocks if they are obvious. Don't add docblock comments when defining variables, unless instructed to, like `/** @var \App\Models\User $currentUser */`. Generate comments only for something that needs extra explanation for the reasons why that code was written.
- For new features, you MUST generate PHPUnit automated tests (this project does not use Pest).
- For library documentation, if some library is not available in Laravel Boost 'search-docs', always use context7. Automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

## PHP instructions
 
- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Generate Enums always in the folder `app/Enums`, not in the main `app/` folder, unless instructed differently.
- Always use Enum value as the default in the migration if column values are from the enum. Always casts this column to the enum type in the Model.
- Don't create temporary variables like `$currentUser = auth()->user()` if that variable is used only one time.
- Always use Enum where possible instead of hardcoded string values, if Enum class exists. For example, in Blade files, and in the tests when creating data if field is casted to Enum then use that Enum instead of hardcoding the value.
 
---
 
## Laravel instructions
 
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in Service classes
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Other examples: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`, or `str()->slug()` instead of `Str::slug()`.
- Don't use `whereKey()` or `whereKeyNot()`, use specific fields like `id`. Example: instead of `->whereKeyNot($currentUser->getKey())`, use `->where('id', '!=', $currentUser->id)`.
- Don't add `::query()` when running Eloquent `create()` statements. Example: instead of `User::query()->create()`, use `User::create()`.
- In Livewire projects, don't use Livewire Volt. Only Livewire class components.
- When adding columns in a migration, update the model's `$fillable` array to include those new attributes.
- Never chain multiple migration-creating commands (e.g., `make:model -m`, `make:migration`) with `&&` or `;` — they may get identical timestamps. Run each command separately and wait for completion before running the next.
- Enums: If a PHP Enum exists for a domain concept, always use its cases (or their `->value`) instead of raw strings everywhere — routes, middleware, migrations, seeds, configs, and UI defaults.
- Controllers: Single-method Controllers should use `__invoke()`; multi-method RESTful controllers should use `Route::resource()->only([])`
- Don't create Controllers with just one method which just returns `view()`. Instead, use `Route::view()` with Blade file directly.
- Always use Laravel's @session() directive instead of @if(session()) for displaying flash messages in Blade templates.
- In Blade files always use `@selected()` and `@checked()` directives instead of `selected` and `checked` HTML attributes. Good example: @selected(old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value). Bad example: {{ old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value ? 'selected' : '' }}.

## Testing instructions
 
### Before Writing Tests
 
  1. **Check database schema** - Use `database-schema` tool to understand:
     - Which columns have defaults
     - Which columns are nullable
     - Foreign key relationship names
 
  2. **Verify relationship names** - Read the model file to confirm:
     - Exact relationship method names (not assumed from column names)
     - Return types and related models
 
  3. **Test realistic states** - Don't assume:
     - Empty model = all nulls (check for defaults)
     - `user_id` foreign key = `user()` relationship (could be `author()`, `employer()`, etc.)
     - When testing form submissions that redirect back with errors, assert that old input is preserved using `assertSessionHasInput()`.
